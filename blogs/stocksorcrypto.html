            much stock they own. Units of stock are called <strong>shares</strong>.They are like partnerships only its
            just you have relatively really small capital contribution and also you can trade it actively if its listed
            on any Stock Exchange(a place where companies lists themselves and with the help of brokers any one can
            trade their shares freely). These are one of the best way to win from inflation in earlier times but in this
            covid time inflation shown very fast growth which is not at much face by capital markets </p>

        <h2>Crypto-Currencies</h2>
        <p><strong>Cryptocurrency</strong> is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes
            it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based
            on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining
            feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them
            theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.</p>
