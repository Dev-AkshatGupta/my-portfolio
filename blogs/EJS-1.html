        <p>
            JavaScript a language which was made to be written on script side of Browser but now it formed so strong
            formation that around 50% of net is based on it.This blog is all about Eloquent Java Script chapter-1.I will
            talk about every topic in this Book , this is just my first blog on first chapter.
            JavaScript
        </p>
        <h2>Types of Values in JavaScript</h2>
        <p> There are mainly six types of values in JS that are - <strong>Numbers,Strings,Boolean Values,Null,Un-defined
            </strong> Each values have diffrent meaning and also diffrent purpose to solve. </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Numbers</strong>-Very simply in Layman terms these values are simple numeric values which we use
                in ou day to day life . These values are mainly use for arithmetic operations ( multiplication ,
                addition ,subtraction , division and so on).There are also three special numbers that are Infinity ,
                -Infinity , NAN (not a number) </li>
            <li><strong>Strings</strong> text-Its simple as words written inside quotes("") are the Strings.
                You can have write Strings inside double-quotes(""),single-quotes(''),back-ticks(``).VArious string
                properties consists of <strong>Escaping</strong> which basically helps to change the line without
                escaping from the quotes or back-ticks that is achieved by using backslash.Strings can't be multiplied
                or divided any text can't be from very definition they just can be concatenated(that is joined) by using
                "+" symbol. </li>
            <!-- <li><strong>Unary Operators, Automatic Type conversion</strong></li> -->
            <li><strong>Boolean Values (True/False)</strong>This kind of values are used for comparision where we
                compare values.<em>Comparison</em>These values are comparing in between similar kind of values </li>
            <li><strong>Empty Values-Null and Un-defined</strong>These are two special values that are used to denote
                the absence meaningful value.They are values but they carry no information. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Automatic Type Conversion</h3>
        <p>Sometimes when operators are applied on wrong types of values JS will convert those to required types by following some set of rules this is called <strong>Type Coercion</strong>like concatinating a number written in string format with a Number value it concatenates but results vary once you subtract a number from a number written in a string value thats where  type coercion comes in the picture</p>
        <h3>Unary Operator</h3>
        <p>All operators are not symbols.One of the example of this is <strong>typeOf </strong>which returns the type of
            the value as the name suggests. Operators that use two values are called <strong>Binary Operators</strong>,
            while those that take one are called <strong>Unary Operators</strong></p>

        <h2>Logical-Operators</h2>
        <p><strong>Logical Operators</strong> are the operations that can be applied to Boolean-Values
            themselves.Javascript support three logical operators <strong>and</strong>,<strong>or</strong> and
            <strong>not</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>&&-</strong>This represents logical and.It is binary operator and its result is <em>true</em> if
                both the values are true otherwise false </li>
            <li><strong>||-</strong>This is a logical or. If either values are true it returns true.</li>
            <li><strong>!-</strong>This is value which produces these kind or results !true = false and !false = true.That are in the way saying notTrue and notFalse.</li>
        </ol>
