        <p >
    Decades of burning fossil fuels on Earth led ud to nothing more than a polluted and pathetic air to  breath and continious defforestation made it even worse for every living-being though solar power and Electri cars gave us a lot of hope its still needs to be looked after as its still have drawbacks and its own problems.</p>
    <h2>what are we all upto?</h2>
<p>We all have seen a paradigm shift in the thinking and the usage of fossil-fuels for making our air more breathable and more pure and much better to live for humans and other living-Beings.<stron>Electric Automobile</strong> these new ways of transport are more hightech more sufficient moe intelligent and makes less pollution as compared to thier old fossil fuel powered counterparts.But are we still looking forward towards renewable sources because these electric powered vehicles are good only if they are charged thorugh solar or wind or any other <strong>renewable power</strong> source.But we in <strong>India</strong>were not prepared for such shifts</p>
<h2>whats changes we are facing?</h2>
<p> There are many changes to still look after in <strong>Automobile Industry</strong> case though thers lot of paradigm shift are still under their ways but many changes started shaping in out country India too.</p>   
<ol>
    <li><strong>Economical</strong>these automobiles are really ecocnomical as compared to those old fuel drinking automobiles</li>
    <li><strong>Automobile Manufacturers</strong> starts considering  Indian Audience for Electric cars otherwise earlier Indian audience was used to taken granted that the market is not matured for such Electric fourwheelers and two-wheelers</li>
<li><strong>Charging Infrastructure</strong> is a need for all such vehicles relevance without them you would found yourself stuck in between somewhere in your trip and the major used to be drawback charging time is also very less with high capacity chargers</li>
<li><strong>Government Policies</strong> are acting as oil in fire wood and helping people to change their mindsets for electric automobiles and lucrative schemes and benefits making consumer to look after electric automobiles  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Challenges Ahead</h2>
<p>Lots of work and research had made humans so capable that they are started doing everything which our ancestros use to think impossible,same things are not impossible but theres always problems always remains in front of every new idea so, in that way only there are problems for electric automobiles  
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Unclear-Vision</strong>govenments unclear vision towards electric auto-mobiles production leads to chaos as there are many state govenments in India which have adopted the schemes while others are still unclear wht to do </li>
<li><strong>Weak-Infrastructure</strong> to support something big like this needs a great Infrastructure not to only just produce the vehicles but also to keep on sustaining vehicles there is requirement to have electric charging stations as gas stations </li>
<li><strong>Sustainibility</strong>there are many sustainibility questions regarding such vehicles as they are very new in technology which makes everyone think about their reliability and sustainibility</li>
</ol>
<h4>Its intresting to look at the future of the electric vehicles as they are going to be proven as a really paradigm shift no for India but for the whole world.</h4>
